## Binary Tree

* Each node can have maximum of two child

## Types of Binary Tree
* Full Binary Tree
* Complete Binary Tree
* Perfect Binary Tree
* Balanced Binary Tree
* Degenerate Binary Tree


## Full Binary Tree
* In which every node has 2 or 0 children

## Complete Binary Tree
* All levels completely filled with nodes except the last level
* In the last level, all the nodes are as left side as possible

## Perfect Binary Tree
* In which all internal nodes have 2 children
* All the leaf nodes are at the same depth or same level

## Balanced Binary Tree
* The height of the left and the height of the right subtrees of every node node may differ by at most 1

## Degenerate Binary Tree
* Every parent node has only one child node
