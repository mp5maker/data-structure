## Complexity Analysis

### How to define good code ?

- Run Fast
- Require Less Memory
- Readable
- Give output correctly

### Good code divided into parts ?

- Readable
- Scalable

### Scalable divided into parts ?

- Time
- Space

### Time Complexity

- Amount of time it takes to run the an algorith
- Algorithm runs fast, better time complexity

### Space Complexity

- Amount of extra space our algorithm requires
- Algorithm takes less space, better space complexity

### Big O

- It doesn't depend on time since time depends on the hardware
- It depends on how many steps we are performing
- The main focus is to calculate the amount of work we do

### Big O Complexity Chart

| No  | Type     | Status   | Used In    |
| --- | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 1   | O(1)     | Good     | --         |
| 2   | O(logn)  | Good     | --         |
| 3   | O(n)     | Fair     | for, while |
| 4   | O(nlogn) | Bad      | --         |
| 5   | O(n^2)   | Horrible | --         |
| 6   | O(2^n)   | Horrible | --         |
| 6   | O(n!)    | Horrible | --         |

- Type: is the number of operations we are performing
- Elements: number of inputs
