## Tree Traversal

### Two ways to traverse
* Breadth-first traversal
* Depth-first traversal

```
       A
   B       C
D    E   F
```

### Breadth First Traversal
* Level Order Traversal [ABCDEF]

### Depth First Traversal
* Sequence of connected nodes
* PreOrder
* InOrder
* PostOrder

### Pre Order
* Root Left Right
* ABDECF
* Trick is to check (1st time)

### In Order
* Left Root Right
* DBEAFC
* Trick is to check (2nd time)

### Post Order
* Left Right Root
* DEBFCA
* Trick is to check (last time)
