## Logarithm

log<sub>b</sub>(x) = y

x = b<sup>y</sup>

---

We always assume the binary for logarithm in Computer Science

b = 2

---

log<sub>2</sub>(n) = y

x = 2<sup>y<sup>

---
Therefore when we double the value of n, <br/>
the value of log only increases by one

```
log(1) = 0
log(2) = 1
log(4) = 2
log(8) = 3
log(16) = 4
log(32) = 5
log(64) = 6
```

## Where can we expect log ?

We see usage of log during searching
and sorting algorithms
